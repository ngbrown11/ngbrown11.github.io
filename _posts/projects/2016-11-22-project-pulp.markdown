**Packaged Software**

A system of software applications, or connected applications, for the healthcare industry. <!--sep-->This is a system of software applications, to be used for connecting patient users to their healthcare practitioners.
The software enables the user to use a mobile application to direct message their health provider with a picture, and a description of what
concerns them . The provider will receive the message on their desktop application (for an office computer) or on their mobile application. They can then reply with a simple message to either alleviate their
patients concerns, or recommend they schedule an appointment. The software system is comprised of:
- Mobile application for the patient (currently only Android)
- Mobile application for the health provider (currently only Android)
- A desktop application for the health provider (supported on Windows/MacOS/Linux)

#### This app can be useful in a number of ways: ####

- Provides a patient with an easy way to quickly contact their health provider
- Helps to reduce unnecessary appointment scheduling for minor issues
- Encourages greater self-interest in a patient's own health

#### Future plans: ####

In the future, my team and I intend to:

- update the mobile application UI
- connect the applications to a database such as Google Firebase

#### I will add more information regarding Project PULP soon! ####
