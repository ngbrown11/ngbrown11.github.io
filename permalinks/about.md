#### I am a full-time senior majoring in Computer Information Systems with a specialization in Health Informatics. I am an extremely motivated individual and I am interested in programming and software development. I have some formal education in programming, but I am mostly self-taught. I have recently acquired the Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer certification (for java se 8). I also have skills with the python programming language and basic web development (html, javascript, css). I am very eager to find a position or an internship in which I can utilize my skills to help an organization develop and grow, as well as myself. ####
