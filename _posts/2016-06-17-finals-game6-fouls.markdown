The integrity of the NBA is slowly being compromised by the softening of the game, as well as the huge difference in the foul calls 
made by the referees. In last nights game 6 of the Finals, the Cavaliers vs. the Warriors, there was atleast two egregious foul calls 
made by the referees; arguably three calls. All of these calls were not just egregious, but they were all called on one player, and 
he just so happened to be the NBA's MVP. The calls completely disrupted the game and caused Stephen Curry to react in such a way that 
resulted in him throwing his mouthpiece, and hitting a Cleveland fan with it (granted, it was completely accidental). These asinine 
calls lead to Curry ultimately receiving his first ever ejection from a basketball game. Now im not in any way saying that the calls 
are the reason the Warriors lost Game 6, but before Curry was ejected they definitely still had a chance to make a comeback.
